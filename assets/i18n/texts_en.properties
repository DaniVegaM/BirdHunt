about_label=About
about_p1=Hi! Thanks for playing Bird Hunt.
about_p2=First off, I just wanna say that this game is more of a Proof of Concept/Tech Demo rather than a full-fledged game. The S Pen wasn't really designed for motion controls in games, so expect some bugs related to controls, random disconnects, and other issues. The S Pen SDK used in this game was last updated by Samsung 5 years ago, and they've removed this functionality in their latest devices. So if the game isn't working properly on your Galaxy device now, unfortunately, it's never gonna work any better.
about_p3=For the best connection with the S Pen during gameplay you MUST REMOVE THE S PEN FROM THE DEVICE BEFORE LAUNCHING THE GAME AND WAIT FOR A SUCCESSFUL CONNECTION, INDICATED BY THIS ICON IN THE STATUS BAR:
about_p4=LAUNCH THE GAME ONLY AFTER SUCCESSFUL CONNECTION.
about_p5=The game should work on the Note10, Ultra series from S20 to S24, Galaxy Tabs, and any other devices that support the S Pen with Air Actions:

about_p7=But like I said earlier, whether the game works on your device is kinda random. It might, but it also might not.
about_p8=As for the game itself, it's inspired by a classic '80s arcade shooter, but instead of a plastic gun, you're using the S Pen to take aim and shoot. The crosshair moves based on the S Pen's gyroscope, and you fire using the button on the pen. For the best accuracy, try tilting your wrist rather than moving your whole hand.\nEvery 6 birds you hit, a new round begins - each one faster and more challenging than the last. As you progress, more birds will appear on the screen, and they'll start moving even quicker.
about_p9=This game was written in Kotlin using the libGDX framework and you can find the source code on GitHub:
